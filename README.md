# installation
First install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) 

Now that Anaconda's installed, you can create a virtual environment, named selfdrivingcar, with Python 3.6 installed. To do this you need to open
a terminal and enter some commands. Here's how to open it for the three systems:
1. For Linux users, just press Ctrl + Alt + T.
2. For Mac users, press Cmd + Space, and then in the Spotlight Search enter
Terminal.
3. For Windows users, click the Windows button at the lower left corner of your screen, find anaconda in the list of programs, and click to open Anaconda prompt. A black window will open; that's the terminal you'll use to install the packages.

# Inside the terminal, enter the following command:
1.conda create -n selfdrivingcar python=3.6
2.conda activate selfdrivingcar

# Installing PyTorch
3.conda install pytorch==0.3.1 -c pytorch

# Installing Kivy
4.conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf201901 kivy

# Finally 
let's enter the final command, right now. It's this:
python map.py
